He creates informative and creative posters, flyers and logos, websites, maps, and other designs. He began practicing graphic design in high school after wanting to try to expand his passion of digital photography and editing into additional digital art forms. Since then, he has been experimenting with and finding new and interesting ways to visually express ideas. His work uses clean and simple shapes, vibrant colors, and informative text in a cohesive manner to create eye-catching and clear graphics. In addition to his graphic design work, Noah is also a programmer and developer, being proficient in a variety of frontend development languages. He is currently a student at Drexel University studying graphic design and user experience and interaction design.
