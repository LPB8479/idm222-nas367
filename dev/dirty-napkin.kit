            <p><span class="dnBold">The Window</span> is a small restaurant opened by the owners of Bob &amp; Barbara's Lounge to provide quick comfort food to patrons of their bar in South Philly. Inspired by the retro decor of the bar and the American comfort food on the menu, we settled on a bold and eye-catching brand identity featuring classic diner tiles with gooey corners reminiscent of greasy burgers.</p>

            <p>The <span class="dnBold">American Scripture Project</span> is a curriculum designed to promote discourse about democracy and community through discussion and analysis of classic American texts. Our primary source of inspiration for this project was the experience of an immigrant to the US. The logo, a document with a stylized Statue of Liberty crown, is supplemented by a set of stamps, grids and dividing lines reminiscent of historical immigration paperwork. We also designed the layout for facilitator guides and participant handouts for the curriculum, where we were able to further explore those elements. For the handouts, we also made sure to leave plenty of whitespace all around the page. This was done to encourage discourse and let participants write notes everywhere on the printouts and make their pages their own.</p>

        <section class="dnSect" id="thoseEyes">
            <p><span class="dnBold">Those Eyes</span> is a psychological thriller short film about a man disassociating and jumping through different worlds to escape his past. We used collaged typefaces to represent the mixing of these worlds in the character's mind, and created a system of image treatments to allow this concept to be expanded into numerous collages. We chose to use physical collages to reflect the director's decision to be very hands-on in the production of the film and to use minimal digital effects.</p>

            <p><span class="dnBold">The Lemonade Stand</span> is a production company trying to bring a new freshness to Philly's theater scene. To reflect that, we used rough type and bold colors for this logo.</p>
